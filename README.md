# Bullers-Photo-Editor
Photo editor with cool features, utilizing image matrices!

# Issues
* The transformBAD method in the ExtendedImage class works to some extent, but makes the image blurry, I dont know what is going on, so I just chose to take the easy way out
* It literally only shows the menu so far, but it can convert images, now to just add that into a friendly UI
* No other team members to help me :'(
