# Not currently being pursued
Seems like a waste of time at the moment, return later and maybe something will have happened, I dunno.

# Bullers-Photo-Editor
Photo editor with cool features, utilizing image matrices!

# Execution
* Download the repository as ZIP file, and extract it, and double click BPE.jar
* Profit?

# Issues
* The transformBAD method in the ExtendedImage class works to some extent, but makes the image blurry, I dont know what is going on, so I just chose to take the easy way out
* It literally only shows the menu so far, but it can convert images, now to just add that into a friendly UI
* No other team members to help me :'(
